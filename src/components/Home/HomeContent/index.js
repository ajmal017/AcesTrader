      <h4>ACESTRADER</h4>

        <i>
          The AcesTrader program is hobby project by a retired coder, created as an experiment in an easily managed system for end-of-day trading of stocks and ETFs using the API
          interface of TDAmeritrade's services.

      <h4>TRADE PROSPECTS</h4>
      <p>
        Two types of trading are envisioned: swing trading and trend following. Three lists of prospective trade entries are available. For swing trading there are a prospective
        buys list and a short sales list. For trend following there is a prospective trend buys list. You use the Edit Lists menu selection to change the list of symbols in each.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ETF swing trading, lists of ETFs can be obtained from the weekly list of "Buy on the Dip Prospects" and "Sell on the Pop Prospects" published in "The Daily ETF Roundup"
        by ETFdb.com. Each Buy on the Dip prospect is deemed to be in an uptrend, and each Sell on the Pop prospect is deemed to be in a downtrend.
      </p>

      <p>
        For ETF trend buys, ETFs that follow diversified assets are used. The long term trend is indicated by the 50-day moving average being above or below its 200-day moving
        average. For a discussion of trading by trend following see{' '}

      {/* <h5>Buy on the Dip Prospects</h5>
      <p>
        The ETFs from ETFdb.com that are included in this list are rated as buy candidates for two reasons. First, each of these funds is deemed to be in an uptrend based on the
        fact that its 50-day moving average is above its 200-day moving average, which are popular indicators for gauging long-term and medium-term trends, respectively.
        <br />
        Second, each of these ETFs is also trading below its five-day moving average, thereby offering a near-term ‘buy on the dip’ opportunity, given the longer-term uptrend at
        hand. Note that this prospects list also features a liquidity screen by excluding ETFs with average trading volumes below the one million shares mark.
      </p>
      <h5>Sell on the Pop Prospects</h5>
      <p>
        The ETFs from ETFdb.com that are included in this list are rated as sell candidates for two reasons. First, each of these funds is deemed to be in a downtrend based on the
        fact that its 50-day moving average is below its 200-day moving average, which are popular indicators for gauging long-term and medium-term trends, respectively.

      <h4>CHARTING TOOLS</h4>
      <p>
        Charts are created for each ETF and are arranged for inspection in three groups under Prospects: Swing Buys, Swing Short Sales, and Trend Buys. Also in three groups under
        Positions: Swing Longs, Swing Shorts, and Trend Longs. Each chart has an associated dashboard with parameters initialized for the default order. A button allows the user to
        enter an order.
      </p>

      {/* <h4>TRADER ALERTS</h4>
      <p>
        An alert will be generated when the price chart shows an event such as crossing a trend line.
        A list of triggered alerts is available in the Alerts page. Each alert
        includes a link to the associated ETF chart page. The user can navigate there to inspect the chart and decide on an available dashboard action.
      </p>
 */}

      <h4>TRADER ACTIONS</h4>
      <p>
        The user has available trading options on the dashboard. These include placing an order to establish a position, either long or short depending on the ETF's grouping, or
        exiting the current position. The options also include removing the ETF from the prospects list. Note that orders are not placed automatically by the program, they are
        manually placed by the user.
      </p>

      <h4>PLACING ORDERS</h4>
      <p>
        Orders to enter or exit a position are placed by manual operation from the user. The program tries to make this manual procedure as frictionless as possible. Pressing an
        order button will present a form prefilled with default order instructions and a submit button. The user can submit as is, or customize before submitting. Users can always
        place stop-loss orders or use profit-taking orders through the interface of TDAmeritrade's services.
      </p>

      <h4>USING THE PROGRAM</h4>
      <p>
        The program as designed can only be used for trading by one person, using the assigned TDAmeritrade logon user name and password. However a Demo mode is provided as a guest
        SignIn option. This mode has no interaction with TDAmeritrade. Price data for charts is obtained from the IEX stock exchange. Trades are simulated using the IEX price data
        for execution prices. These prices are obtained at the time of the order, and they are from a 15-minute delayed ticker feed. But good enough for the demo's simulated swing
        trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's another limitation to the Demo mode. There is no access to the cloud storage. The data for your lists are saved in the local storage of your browser. If you create
        your lists on your desktop computer, you won't be able to see the same data using the program on your iPad. Make your lists there to use your iPad for the demo.
