      <h2>A DEMO WITH PAPER MONEY TRADING</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        You have full access to the program's functions. Please understand the program is still in a Beta test state. Some features are not fully programmed yet. For instance, you
        do not have the ability to change the parameters of your orders. All entries are submitted as market day orders for a quantity costing $5,000. All exit orders are for all
        shares.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create lists of prospective buys and short sells to watch. You can do simulated executions of order instructions to open and close trades. Your trading results are
        kept in a list of trades. These lists are kept in a database and are available to you over subsequent logins. So you can paper trade here over days to test your trading
        ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demo mode has no interaction with any brokerage firm. Price data for charts is obtained from the IEX stock exchange. Order executions are simulated using the IEX price
        data for fill prices. These prices are obtained at the time of you order, and they are the last price from the ticker feed. So after trading hours they are stale, but still
        good enough for the demo's simulated swing trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's another limitation to the demo mode. There is no access to cloud storage. The data for your lists are saved in the local storage of your browser. If you create your
        lists on your desktop computer, you won't be able to see the same data using the program on your iPad or iPhone. So make your lists in the browser and device you will use
        for your paper money trading sessions. You can of course, use another browser and device to persue a second trading strategy, without affecting the other.
